    Performs the SARSA(λ) algorithm for temporal difference learning.

    SARSA(λ) uses eligibility traces to update Q-values for all state-action
    pairs visited in an episode, with exponentially decaying weights.

    Args:
        env: environment instance
        Q: numpy.ndarray of shape (s,a) containing the Q table
        lambtha: eligibility trace factor (λ ∈ [0,1])
        episodes: total number of episodes to train over
        max_steps: maximum number of steps per episode
        alpha: learning rate (α)
        gamma: discount rate (γ)
        epsilon: initial threshold for epsilon greedy
        min_epsilon: minimum value that epsilon should decay to
        epsilon_decay: decay rate for updating epsilon between episodes
